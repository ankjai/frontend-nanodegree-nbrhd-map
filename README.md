## Project 5-1: Neighborhood Map Project


#### Project Overview

Develop a single page application featuring a map of your neighborhood or a neighborhood you would like to visit. You will then add additional functionality to this map including highlighted locations, third-party data about those locations and various ways to browse the content.


#### How to Run the App

###### Grunt
If you already have node.js and grunt-cli installed, then you can resolve project dependencies by running:
```
npm install
```
Now do:
```
grunt connect
```
This will start web server on http://localhost:8080
